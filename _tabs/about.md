# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

I'm Walid MENGHOUR, a Cybersecurity Engineer with a strong focus on Security Operations (SOC), Incident Response (IR), and Digital Forensics. This blog is my personal space to share what I learn, encounter, and explore as I work on securing systems and investigating digital threats.

I've learned a lot from the cybersecurity community over the yearsâ€”from threat researchers and red/blue teamers to digital forensic expertsâ€”and this is my way of giving back. Whether you're just starting out or deep into your cyber journey, I hope the insights and walkthroughs I share here help you grow, solve problems, and defend better.

Cybersecurity is more than a jobâ€”it's a constantly evolving challenge. Through this site, Iâ€™ll document not only what I know, but also what Iâ€™m learning as the threat landscape shifts and technology advances.

Hereâ€™s a look at the key topics I plan to cover:

* Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows and real-world use cases  
* Incident Detection & Response (IDR) best practices  
* Digital Forensics techniques and tooling  
* Threat hunting, intelligence, and adversary behavior analysis  
* SIEM tuning (Elastic, Splunk, etc.) and log parsing (Logstash, syslog, etc.)  
* Open-source security tools (Suricata, Snort, Zeek, and more)  
* Cybersecurity lab setups and practical walkthroughs  
* Tips for aspiring SOC Analysts and DFIR professionals

Stay curious. Stay alert. Stay secure.
